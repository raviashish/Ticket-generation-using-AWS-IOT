# Ticket-generation-using-AWS-IOT

This code uses an AWS IOT button to generate a ticket.
Imagine you have an issue with your PC or any program at your workplace. This code can send a ticket with just a click of a button. This ticket will be stored in your company database for the required persons to access and work upon.

AWS IOT button has 3 functions- Single, Double and a Long Click.

The functions of the button describes the level of severity or problem.

Single click would mean that the issue is not much of importance, which means a "LOW" level ticket is generated. Double click generates a "MEDIUM" ticket and long "HIGH" ticket


Please do provide any feedback and comments.
